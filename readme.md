# Hours Payment Tracker

Sometimes, the prospect of earning more motivates us to work overtime. If you're looking for a way to visually track your overtime earnings in real-time without the hassle of manual calculations, you've found the right tool. The Hours Payment Tracker is designed to show you exactly how much money you're making every second of your overtime work. Simply set it up on a side window, and take a glance whenever you're curious about your earnings. Let's get started.
